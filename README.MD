# Learning something

It's a learning project to study things.
Just using technologies which we don't use at work but that
are interesting to learn for me. I'll keep the list of new
things here and hope it'll grow.

# What I use and study here

<details>
<summary>Spring Framework</summary>

#### Learning:

- Spring for beginners [certificate](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-d33a0011-e7dc-4d0b-a55e-1956d3dec908/)
    - Finished: 18 March 2023
    - Spring a must-know tool to increase ones chances on the market
    - I couldn't use it on my job, so started with something

<details>
<summary>Gradle</summary>

#### Using:

- Just decided to use it instead of Maven
- I had a big job experience with Maven, but nothing with Gradle
- Didn't meet any problems on basic usage - mostly it's just another syntax

    <summary>GitHub Actions</summary>

#### Learning:

- GitHub Actions - The Complete
  Guide [certificate](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-852683ac-bea0-4019-a120-264cbbda7bed/)
    - Finished: 23 July 2023
    - On my job, we moved to GitHub. I thought - now we can implement some CI/CD. Just need to learn about that.

#### Examples:

- Common triggers ('on'): [link](.github/workflows/demo-triggers.yml)
- Repository / environment variables and secrets [link](.github/workflows/demo-env-variables-secrets.yml)
- Using artifacts, outputs and cache: [link](.github/workflows/demo-artifacts-outputs-cache.yml)
- Conditions to run job / step and behaviour on failure: [link](.github/workflows/demo-conditions-errors.yml)
- Matrix - perform several times with different parameter combinations: [link](.github/workflows/demo-matrix.yml)
- Reusable workflow:
    - Example: [link](.github/workflows/demo-reusable-workflow-define.yml)
    - Example usage: [link](.github/workflows/demo-reusable-workflow-use.yml)
- Custom actions:
    - Composite: [link](.github/actions/example-composite-action/action.yml)
    - JavaScript: [link](.github/actions/example-js-action)
    - Docker (Java): [link](.github/actions/example-docker-action)
    - Using the actions: [link](.github/workflows/demo-custom-actions-use.yml)
- Security vulnerabilities:
    - Script injection vulnerabilities: [link](.github/workflows/demo-security-script-injection-threat.yml)
    - Permissions and $GITHUB_TOKEN: [link](.github/workflows/demo-security-github-token.yml)

<summary>OAUTH 2.0</summary>

#### Learning:

- The Nuts and Bolts of OAuth
  2.0 [certificate](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-aaa657a0-1fca-4283-8c53-9b5886e3a3bc/)
    - Finished: 17 Jun 2023
    - On my job I faced an issue with Single Sign-On certificate expiration. Couldn't find any help, so decided
      to learn about authorization things. After the course I knew what exactly to ask, so the issue was solved.
    - This topic appeared to be very interesting, so I decided to make a pet project to play with that. When started,
      found that there are even more useful (and market valuable) technologies to study before that.
