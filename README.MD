# Learning something

It's a learning project to study things.
Just using technologies which we don't use at work but that
are interesting to learn for me. I'll keep the list of new
things here and hope it'll grow.

# What I use and study here

<details>
<summary>Spring Framework</summary>

#### Learning:

- Spring for beginners [certificate](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-d33a0011-e7dc-4d0b-a55e-1956d3dec908/)
    - Finished: 18 March 2023
    - Spring a must-know tool to increase ones chances on the market
    - I couldn't use it on my job, so started with something

<details>
<summary>Gradle</summary>

- Just decided to use it instead of Maven
- I had a big job experience with Maven, but nothing with Gradle
- Didn't meet any problems on basic usage - mostly it's just another syntax

#### Learning:

- Reusable workflow:
    - Example: [link](.github/workflows/demo-reusable-workflow-define.yml)
